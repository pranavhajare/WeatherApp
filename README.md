# Weather Application with Node and Express

This is a complete weather application built using Node.js and Express. In this project, you will learn how to set up a static public directory using Express.js and render Handlebars files. Additionally, you will follow best practices in terms of project structure and coding standards while building fully functional REST APIs with Node and Express.

## Features

- Set up a static public directory to serve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Render dynamic HTML views using Handlebars.
- Implement a RESTful API to fetch weather information.
- Follow best project structure practices.
- Adhere to coding standards and best practices.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Handlebars
- RESTful APIs
